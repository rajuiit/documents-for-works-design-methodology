00:09:07,00:13:03,"What I am going to share with you today, understanding the basics of NLP already right, "
00:13:16,00:16:16,going to share with you somthing called the fundamentals positioning of selling.
00:17:09,00:19:09,For those who are in the selling trade.
00:20:04,00:29:13,"Okay very short, in within half an hour, I will give you a sense of what helps to consistently be in a certain state to sell."
00:29:20,00:31:23,"For those who are not into selling, it's okay."
00:32:11,00:36:03,Why? Because it's the same fundamental that whatever you want to do well. 
00:36:20,00:39:09,"For those who are in whatever trades you are in, "
00:40:05,00:42:22,"if you want to do well in the trade, it's the same concept."
00:43:16,00:44:00,Can?
00:44:13,00:46:14,"So one thing we are going to start off this, "
00:47:10,00:51:10,"when you start talking to people, when you start communicating with people, "
00:53:05,00:58:16,"when you go into sales trade, okay, and you would like to."
00:58:24,01:01:00,I presume you would like to convince the person to go and buy.
01:01:18,01:03:00,Am I right? Okay.
01:03:15,01:04:24,"How would you, how do you normally start?"
01:06:06,01:08:09,How do you normally start a sales conversation?
01:09:01,01:10:05,Firstly build rapport.
01:10:15,01:12:13,"Okay, so tell me how you build rapport?"
01:13:11,01:15:23,"Say how are you, how is your day all that."
01:16:04,01:19:23,"Okay, so you evoke a small talk conversation am I right?"
01:20:16,01:23:22,"Okay, how do you normally start your sales talk?"
01:24:02,01:26:16,Self introduce yourself to the person first.
01:26:21,01:27:05,Okay.
01:28:01,01:31:24,And then some greetings.
01:32:06,01:34:03,"When you start your small talk, "
01:34:13,01:40:10,"and you find that the person smiles back and talk to you in a very friendly manner, do you like it?"
01:41:07,01:41:19,Okay.
01:42:14,01:47:15,"When you talk to the person, you know you ask a few questions, the person gives you the one sentence answer, "
01:48:04,01:52:08,"Okay, I am fine I am alright, are you okay?  "
01:53:15,01:55:05,"Ya, that means he is like not interested."
01:56:03,01:57:15,"Okay, so that is the reading right."
01:58:03,02:00:08,"So today session, what I am going to share with you is very simple."
02:00:16,02:03:08,"Whatever the person is dealing with you right, on right, "
02:03:21,02:08:13,"how do you capture the signal, adjust the signal, return the signal."
02:09:02,02:11:00,So that the conversation starts rolling.
02:11:11,02:16:16,"When the person gives you the one sentence, doesn't mean he is not interested to communicate with you."
02:17:11,02:19:17,Doesn't mean that the selling doesn't happen.
02:20:15,02:26:14,"Okay. When the person communicates with you in a single sentence information, it tells you something."
02:27:07,02:33:12,"The ability to retract away from your normal selling mode, or you try to go in to sell."
02:33:21,02:34:10,Okay.
02:35:09,02:39:12,The ability to retact away from that gives you a lot of information to capture 
02:40:16,02:43:23,and a lot of information thereafter to return it back to the person.
02:44:14,02:49:01,"Can? So before we start anything, I am going to share with you something call sensory acuity."
02:49:24,02:53:02,"Do you realise that there are things up there, without looking at it."
02:54:05,02:56:00,"Okay, I want you to not only do that."
02:57:02,02:58:17,"When you are listening to me, "
03:00:05,03:01:06,can you hear the aircon?
03:03:06,03:03:14,Yes.
03:04:00,03:05:06,"Some yes, some no."
03:05:16,03:08:02,"Okay, I am going to do an exercise with you, bear with me."
03:08:17,03:11:15,"Trust me on this, I am going to ask you to close your eyes and sit up properly."
03:13:17,03:14:11,Can? Bear with me.
03:16:01,03:18:17,"Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes, sit up properly."
03:19:07,03:20:23,"Okay, in the next moment I am going to ask you to do this."
03:21:00,03:23:00,Put your two feets on the ground.
03:23:22,03:26:17,"I am going to give you a series of instruction, follow me on these instructions."
03:26:20,03:32:17,The purpose of this whole instruction is to give you a sense that you have done this before.
03:33:14,03:36:18,"Okay? This is what we call sensory acuity,"
03:36:21,03:41:05,it means the ability to slide the effect to open up your senses. Okay?
03:41:24,03:49:04,"It's very simple, once you open up your senses, it is easier for you to communicate with people as and one you can go back and focus in as and one."
03:49:19,03:51:06,"As you listen to my voice, "
03:52:10,03:53:24,did you realise that your feets 
03:55:05,03:57:05,are on the gound and you can feel your feet on the ground.
03:57:13,04:04:10,"Not only that, you can also slowly rise up and feel that you butt is on the chair."
04:06:05,04:11:04,"And for those of you whose hands are in your legs, on your thighs, you can feel that."
04:11:19,04:14:14,"For some of you who are on the chairs, for some of you, your hands are folded, "
04:15:01,04:18:06,you can feel that your hands are folded and know where your hands are.
04:18:10,04:19:05,You can sense them.
04:19:21,04:25:20,"Not only that as you slowly, as we slowly go up your body, you realise that you can feel your shoulders."
04:25:22,04:27:05,"Some of you, your shoulders are tight, "
04:28:16,04:33:09,"as you breath in and out, you may want to loosen your shoulders."
04:35:11,04:41:00,And as you slowly be able to feel your back either on the chair or your back is really really straight.
04:42:01,04:43:02,As you breathe in 
04:44:19,04:49:24,"and out, you can feel that your chair is actually heaving in and out. "
04:53:11,05:00:09,"As you listen to my voice, not only can you hear my voice, you will start to realise that you can hear the air-conditioning."
05:03:16,05:05:19,As loud as it can be.
05:07:06,05:14:02,"As you slowly open your eyes and look at me, and focus at staring at me, look at me,"
05:15:07,05:18:17,you realise you can see things beyond.
05:19:15,05:24:22,"Okay, just by looking at me, you can see not looking at me, you can see things beyond and far."
05:25:00,05:26:13,"And you can still hear my voice, "
05:28.00,05:29:14,the voice of the air-condition.
05:29:16,05:30:22,Can hear?
05:31:07,05:37:00,"Okay, and at the same time, feel that you're relaxed, sitting down with your back "
05:37:15,05:42:10,"on the chair for you, and your feets are on the ground, your hands are on the thigh, "
05:42:24,05:46:06,"that your hands are crossed, you are lying down with the back "
05:47:07,05:49:00,and you can still hear the air-con.
05:49:11,05:52:20,"This whole sense, okay, when you are talking to people."
05:52:21,05:57:20,"How many of you, by the way, when you are talking to people sometimes you lose the conversation?    "
05:58:06, 05:59:02,Ever?
06:00:18,06:10:18,"When you lose the conversation, sometimes you are distracted, sometimes it's about having, still being able to catch the conversation but having what we call in this state, peripheral vision."
06:11:15,06:17:22,"Peripheral vision gives you a sense of presence, it's about backing away your senses, seeing things more open."
06:18:19,06:27:18,"And then sometimes when the client tells you something, or your lead tells you something, your prosepct tells you something, you can actually focus back into that conversation."
06:27:22,06:32:12,"When you come out from the conversation like where you are now, you get to hear more things."
06:32:19,06:34:12,You get to sense more things.     
06:34:12,06:36:22,Why? Because you are seeing things at a different persepctive.
06:37:10,06:48:11,"But he starts talking about something, ""Sometimes I worry about my children. I don't whether if I, if anything happens to me they will be provided.""."
06:48:18,06:49:17,What is his concern?
06:51:05,06:52:05,Children right. 
06:52:18,06:54:16,And you know when then you can go in.
06:54:20,07:01:10,"So you see when you are out in that sense, you can actually narrow down into information very very fast."
07:02:01,07:03:00,Does it make sense?
07:03:01,07:07:21,"When you back out, you get a sense of things, you know you hear then you go back in."
07:07:22,07:10:09,This is what we call the peripheral and foveal vision.
07:10:10,07:13:12,"Foveal vision means, understanding something, focusing on it."
07:13:19,07:22:23,"Peripheral means, hearing something, realise that oh, I am missing something here, I better back out, get more sense of it."
07:23:02,07:23:22,Can?
07:23:23,07:28:05,"And by the way when you are listening to people, you got girlfriend?"
07:28:20,07:29:17,No?
07:29:23,07:30:22,Wife definitely.
07:31:06,07:32:19,Do you listen to your wife?
07:34:12,07:36:10,Your wife is not here right?
07:36:11,07:34:13,I must ask this question.
07:34:14,07:39:03,Do you listen to your wife?
07:39:13,07:40:03,At times.
07:40:02,07:49:02,"At times, okay, so during times when you listen to your wife, okay, and you listen and you spend time and you give her the time to listen."
07:50:05,07:51:06,Are you trying to?
07:51:13,07:53:24,"Okay, you know your wife sometimes, wife ah, I am married by the way."
07:54:07,07:58:23,"Wife tells you problems right, do you try to solve the problems for her?"
07:58:24,08:00:12,Try if possible.
08:00:13,08:02:20,"Sometimes okay, sometimes right?"
08:02:21,08:04:06,Try if possible right.
08:04:14,08:06:23,I am going to pop this question over to the lady here.
08:06:22,08:10:09,Would you like a man to keep solving your problems for you?
08:10:10,08:11:07,No.
08:11:08,08:13:11,"Okay, I am going to hear louder."
08:13:12,08:16:22,Do you like the man to try to solve all the problems for you?
08:17:03,08:17:17,No.
08:18:04,08:19:17,"Okay, so why?"
08:20:01,08:21:12,We just want them to listen.
08:21:13,08:23:02,So you just want them to listen right?
08:23:08,08:25:02,So what is a good state for listening?
08:25:19,08:29:06,"When you are trying to find out oh got problem, let me solve it for you."
08:29:12,08:32:04,"Or, you just back away and let her talk?"
08:32:22,08:35:00,Back away and let her talk.
08:35:02,08:38:08,"This is the state, a very good state for listening."
08:38:11,08:41:07,It's a very good state for information aquisition.
08:41:08,08:43:06,It's a very good state for backing off. 
08:43:07,08:45:07,You don't physically back off from a person.
08:46:13,08:51:10,You can use whatever I have shared with you to back off from the person in a mental state.
08:51:10,08:53:11,When you back off it doesn't mean you don't want to talk.
08:53:12,08:56:08,When you back off you are seeing things from wider perspective.
08:56:06,09:02:14,"And you can still see things around me, get a sense of it, and you find that listening actually improves."
09:03:02,09:07:03,"Okay, so this is just sharing with you on what we call peripheral vision."
09:07:12,09:10:22,How would you like 
09:11:10,09:14:01,"to go into sales, "
09:15:08,09:21:24,"okay, and be at a, and feel that you can definitely close it and closed it."
09:23:02,09:25:03,Not a bad thing right? Correct?
09:25:14,09:33:14,"Would you like to be able to intro them and they feel that after the introduction they go, wow, and trust you."
09:34:11,09:37:22,Okay. Would you like the people you are dealing with 
09:38:17,09:43:15,trust you and when you say something they actually acquire the information really fast?
09:44:12,09:49:05,"Okay. So, have you ever had the experience where "
09:49:24,09:55:17,the people you are working with actually instantly have the certain liking and trust you?
09:56:09,10:02:17,"Okay and then, whatever when the information you share with them they go hmm okay cool. Ever?"
10:03:10,10:07:11,Ya. Okay. And when you communicate with
10:08:23,10:19:03,"the clients right, they actually have a very close sense closeness with you and you feel that you are in control."
10:19:05,10:23:06,"And the information that you share with them, they actually open up. Ever?"
10:23:23,10:26:12,"Okay, sometimes. Would you like to be able to,"
10:26:19,10:30:09,I won't say everytime but consistently replicate the situation?
10:30:16,10:31:10,That will be good.
10:31:15,10:38:21,"That will be good right, okay. Let me share the first tool in terms of fundamental positioning of sales or selling."
10:42:02,10:49:07,Have you ever gone into a situation where you are going to meet the client or remember the first time you meet the client that you actually feel nervous.
10:50:11,10:51:12,Ever right.
10:51:17,10:57:19,Have you ever then gone into a situation when you meet the client and you actually feel not that nervous and you feel quite confident?
10:58:07,11:01:02,"Okay, ever right. 
How do you control that?"
11:01:10,11:08:03,"In fundamental of selling right, or positioning of selling, there is something what we call the optimal state."
11:08:16,11:14:06,"In this optimal state, it is actually possible to replicate it using NLP."
11:14:15,11:19:19,Okay. When are we inconsistent and not able to replicate this state?
11:20:20,11:22:23,Very simple. When the mind 
11:23:02,11:29:07,"and whatever we say, and our actions and behaviors right are not aligned and consistent."
11:29:16,11:33:10,Anyone here who don't like to exercise and tell yourselves I will never want to exercise? 
11:33:20,11:37:06,Would you ever want to hopefully can exercise on a more consistent basis?
11:37:14,11:39:13,"Ever right, okay. Mostly yes."
11:39:20,11:44:06,"The health part, kind of part right, okay."
11:44:11,11:46:24,Getting a better body shape and stuff.
11:47:00,11:55:05,"For those of you who want to exercise regularly, and when you want to go and exercise, are there times when you didn't exercise?"
11:56:10,12:03:16,"Ever right. Okay when you want to go and exercise and you didn't, in your mind, do you see yourselves exercising?"
12:04:01,12:06:20,Or want to. Do right?
12:07:00,12:10:00,What did you say to yourselves?
12:10:16,12:15:17,"When you see yourselves that you want to go and exercise, ""I should go and exercise."", what did you say to yourselves after that?"
12:16:02,12:23:00,"Tired ah, never mind tomorrow okay."
12:23:11,12:27:22,Tomorrow there will be a day I can go correct. Never mind today tired. Correct? Okay. 
12:28:02,12:31:06,"And then physically, there is a difference."
12:31:20,12:38:10,"Physically if you are wearing your shoe, your running shoe, ready to go for a run, would you tell yourselves you are tired?"
12:38:16,12:46:00,"No. Probably the day when you are telling yourself that I need to go and exercise, but you say but I am very tired, what would you be doing?"
12:46:14,12:56:00,"Sitting down at the sofa, looking at TV, telling yourselves I am wasting my time, I should have gone to exercise but I very tired."
12:56:07,13:05:20,"So there is this internal combat inside, you know in your mind thats go, the linguistic portion that is telling yourselves tired and stuff like that right."
13:06:01,13:11:01,"In your mind you still want to go exercise, you picture yourself, ya i want to go and exercise, I should go for a run."
13:11:10,13:13:17,Physically you are down there.   
13:14:11,13:19:07,"When the mind or whatever you say and how physically you express it are not consistent, "
13:20:16,13:25:18,"chances of what you want, the optimal state will never happen."
13:26:16,13:28:14,"But when you have all three together, it happens."
13:28:23,13:31:01,And this one is a science research.
13:31:14,13:38:09,"They find that golfers right, when they can think and whatever they say and how their body behaves can be align, "
13:38:16,13:41:06,"okay, the motion itself is very smooth."
13:41:20,13:47:02,"When the three cannot, any one part cannot be align, okay, the motion becomes very awkward."
13:48:09,13:55:08,They have actually done certain research and certain tools attached to the person to see how the swing goes.
13:55:12,13:57:21,So this is a physical sport behavior.
13:58:01,14:01:00,So in terms of sales it's the same thing.
14:01:04,14:05:08,"In terms of sales think of it this way, if you can align your thoughts, "
14:05:18,14:09:01,you can align what you're going to say to yourself and to the client 
14:09:06,14:14:11,"and you can align your behavior, okay, what will happen is this."
14:14:23,14:22:07,"The alignment then creates a state that when you go in you feel, ""hey, not bad, don't know why but not bad.""."
14:08:08,14:26:24,"Talk to the client, the client smiles back to you, ""hey, cool."""
14:27:02,14:28:10,This is the feeling that I want.
14:28:11,14:37:06,"Shake his hand, you know you feel you are in control, confident and you say, ""Mr Tan, I know you have interest in this.""."
14:37:13,14:39:05,So what are you looking for?
14:39:06,14:42:03,Go out on a peripheral vision and listen to him. He talks.
14:42:04,14:49:22,"You focus on one part, you connect to him and you focus on the fact that he wants certain part of the information you feed to him in a very clear manner."
14:49:23,14:52:05,You find the whole process becomes very smooth.
14:52:06,14:55:19,"That, by the way is optimal am I right?"
14:55:20,15:00:14,Would you like to learn how to get into optimal state on a regular basis?
15:01:11,15:02:20,Not a bad idea?
15:02:21,15:05:08,I am going to share with you something call state management.
15:05:09,15:11:18,"State is when the mind, whatever you say to yourself and the behavior aligns right."
15:11:19,15:15:15,The emotion generated inside actually aligns out.
15:16:20,15:19:18,When you tell yourself don't panic.
15:19:21,15:22:16,Go for an interview or whatever you tell yourself don't panic.
15:22:17,15:24:04,Okay in your mind you tell yourself dont't panic.
15:24:15,15:26:19,But the voice says jialat.
15:26:17,15:28:01,How ah how ah?
15:28:02,15:30:10,If I say the wrong things what happen ah?
15:30:11,15:34:04,"And then you start to find that, you know the body don't know why feels abit nervous."
15:34:05,15:35:19,Generated by the emotions.
15:35:20,15:39:02,"And you say never mind, don't worry, cool down, calm down, calm down."
15:39:03,15:45:24,"Okay then the mind comes back, and then you find that when the non-alignment happens again, it re-generate itself."
15:46:22,15:49:23,"You go to the interview, the nervousness is still that right?"
15:49:24,15:55:16,"Okay, how do you get into a state that is actually powerful, positive, helpful atleast."
15:55:17,16:03:12,"So that when you go into any situation where there is an interaction, you go in to any situation that requires you to perform, you are in that state. "
16:03:13,16:07:08,That itself ladies and gentlemen is call state management.
16:07:20,16:15:08,"And, in order to explain state management, in order to get you into an exercise, I need someone to demostrate."
16:15:13,16:29:07,"Everytime when we are in a certain state, okay, it comes off in an alignment of mental picture and what we say to ourselves and how we feel okay."
16:29:08,16:34:19,"What is a, what is some emotion or state that you would love that you would have it on a consistent basis?"
16:35:00,16:35:21,Happy.
16:35:22,16:37:18,"Okay, are you happy?"
16:37:19,16:38:11,I am.
16:38:12,16:45:11,"Okay, what is a state that you would like to have consistently that you can, that you want that you can trigger and you can have it?"
16:45:08,16:46:01,Calm.
16:46:02,16:48:12,"Okay, I hear you."
16:49:17,16:52:20,"Can you remember the, calm is one."
16:52:24,17:00:11,"How about a state when you, when you, you know when you, whatever field you are in right, when you deal with people right."
17:00:18,17:08:11,"Would you like to have a state where you can consistently trigger and you turn around and you talk to the people, you realise you are in control?"
17:08:12,17:08:24,Would it be good?
17:09:00,17:09:15,Ya.
17:09:16,17:27:02,"Okay, can you remember a time that you know you are in control and you are managing a group of people or you are talking to people and you feel that or at least in that state right, whatever you say you can dictate the direction?"
17:27:23,17:29:17,Have you ever felt that?
17:31:02,17:33:05,When you are more confident in what you are delivering.
17:33:06,17:35:24,Have you ever had that experience before?
17:36:00,17:36:18,Ya.
17:36:19,17:37:15,Ever right.
17:37:16,17:42:21,"So by the way, when you ask that question later, okay, please don't ask it in such a way."
17:42:22,17:45:15,"You want someone to feel in control right, okay."
17:45:16,17:48:14,You want someone to be able to feel that he can direct a conversation right.
17:48:15,17:53:24,"Please don't ask the question, have you ever felt in control before?"
17:54:08,18:00:02,"If you don't feel yourself that way right, it is very difficult to get that person to feel the same way."
18:00:03,18:05:17,"so in order to resonate, okay, you yourself got to feel at that level when asking that question."
18:05:18,18:13:22,"Can? So she says, let say I want to be more in control to be more in command, to manage a group of people, okay."
18:13:23,18:15:20,So have you ever being in that state before? Yes?
18:15:21,18:16:23,Yes.
18:16:24,18:19:04,"Okay, can you remember the time that you were in that state?"
18:19:05,18:23:20,"Okay, so you were delivering something, what is the feeling when you were delivering that something?"
18:23:21,18:26:00,You just want to pass on the knowledge.
18:26:01,18:30:19,"Okay, very good, template that in your mind, you want to pass on your knowledge am I right?"
18:30:20,18:32:16,That is the thing that is happening inside am I right?
18:32:17,18:39:24,"Okay so you want to pass on something, so thats what you feel that when you were doing that, it gives you a very directed control am I right?"
18:40:00,18:41:00,"Okay, cool."
18:41:01,18:54:04,"When you were passing on that information, passing on the knowledge okay and dealing with the group of people, in that time, when you felt that you were in direct control, okay you were in command, okay."
18:55:01,18:56:00,How is your body like?
18:56:01,18:57:03,What is your breathing like?
18:59:16,19:01:02,Stable and calm.
19:01:03,19:05:09,"So holding on to that picture that you were in control, looking at the crowd now, "
19:05:10,19:10:14,imagine they were the people and that you are delivering the information down to them okay.
19:10:15,19:11:16,Looking at them.
19:12:03,19:15:09,"And you are breathing in a steady and calm mode, and you telling yourself i am here to contribute."
19:15:15,19:16:18,To be giving them.
19:16:19,19:17:10,Feels good?
19:17:11,19:17:24,Good.
19:18:00,19:19:16,Ya template that can?
19:19:17,19:20:09,Okay thank you very much.
19:20:16,19:26:19,"So it's the same thing, why? Because our previous, by the way, your previous experience, you know when I, when we mention right?"
19:27:02,19:31:18,"You meet up with clients, you did a great sales, how do you leverage on that experience?"
19:32:13,19:37:24,"It's going back remembering that time, knowing what kind of state that you are in."
19:38:18,19:41:16,"And you ask yourselves this, how, what were you thinking, "
19:42:21,19:44:24,what was the thing you said to yourselves.
19:45:12,19:48:08,Or what is the thing that is running through your mind when you were saying to yourself 
19:48:15,19:52:14,"and how does your behavior, what is the one behavior that you have."
19:53:16,19:56:22,"Key thing is this, don't think about all the things."
19:57:07,20:00:04,You cannot emulate and replicate everything.
20:00:14,20:03:24,You emulate and you replicate something I call six degree.
20:04:11,20:08:17,"Six degree means this, this is six. You know how, how, how big six degree is?"
20:09:02,20:10:14,"It's about, about this right?"
20:11:04,20:17:10,"You know right? But six degree, when you do it correctly, over a period of time what happens is this."
20:18:11,20:20:11,It becomes distinct.
20:20:20,20:23:13,"Correct, something so small right, correct?"
20:23:19,20:26:24,"You do it correctly right, over a period of time what happens?"
20:27:12,20:34:12,"The changes or the thing that you want it to, you want to show it out gets bigger and bigger."
20:34:21,20:43:14,"Okay, so this is what I call six degree. So don't think, as I say agin, think about what are the key elements in what you think, what you say to yourself,"
20:43:19,20:45:17,"what you are saying out, okay."
20:45:24,20:52:04,"And how you behave, your breathing, how is your body like."
20:52:24,20:58:07,"You emulate these few small key items, it will replicate the whole state out again."
20:58:22,21:02:19,"Okay, can? Not bad right, good feeling?"
21:03:01,21:06:17,"Okay, cool, so can you replicate it as and when you want?"
21:08:09,21:18:12,"And you know this, the way you replicate it is this, you have to tell yourself, I am giving something important to other people."
21:20:05,21:23:17,"If anyday you feel fustrated and you are not in control, think about it."
21:24:03,21:27:15,"Those that, have there ever being times that you are fustrated and not in control?"
21:28:07,21:31:10,Ever right? Were you trying to deliever something to people?
21:34:03,21:36:06,Or were you trying to control the environment?
21:38:22,21:42:07,"Think, you may not be replicating the optimal state."
21:43:02,21:47:12,"Okay, if you are replicating the optimal state, the result sometimes is more consistent."
21:48:07,21:51:19,"By the way, when you replicate the optimal state doesn't mean it's always the outcome."
21:52:02,21:53:16,There are other environment that affects.
21:53:22,21:56:02,But the chances of consistency is much higher.
21:56:15,21:59:10,"When in sales, when you are selling, "
21:59:20,22:06:17,"okay, in the fundamental of it, what is the optimal state that will help the person to feel comfortable?"
22:07:08,22:12:08,"It's a interesting question. I tell you why, because how you made the person feel comfortable,"
22:12:16,22:15:08,is very different from how you make the person feel comfortable.
22:15:15,22:19:04,And different people does it differently. Your own optimal state is different.
22:19:16,22:25:20,"If I never have that state before, some of the people I met said I never felt in love before."
22:26:08,22:29:01,"Okay, how do I get the feeling of I am in love?"
22:29:09,22:32:23,Correct? Or how do I get into the state I am in love? Correct? Okay.
22:33:06,22:38:15,"Two things, if you never had a state strongly, can you still come out with the state?"
22:39:05,22:43:16,"This person sells, he try to sell this thing in his whole life but never got one buyer."
22:44:04,22:50:09,Don't know where the success comes from. Is it possible still to evoke a state that will get him to an optimal state that he can sell?
22:50:20,22:55:13,"Possible? Yes. One, by someone elses experience."
22:56:07,22:59:23,"Okay, two, remember I told about six degree, okay."
23:00:05,23:03:08,"Six degree you don't want to, you don't want to come to an end immediately."
23:04:00,23:07:06,You start with one thing that will create that end first.
23:07:18,23:13:00,"That state. If you have never, if you felt, if you feel that confident is a far away thing,"
23:13:15,23:16:01,before confident what is that?
23:17:09,23:24:24,"Interesting right? When you have this kind of question, go into your sensory acuity, go into your peripheral vision, think about it."
23:25:09,23:28:03,"Have I ever before confident, "
23:28:17,23:33:04,have I ever had a situation that I am not that confident but I get confident after that? Have you ever?
23:33:14,23:35:13,"Or at least near to confident, ever?"
23:35:21,23:37:07,What is that?
23:39:07,23:42:00,What is the state that build up to confidence?
23:42:15,23:44:20,Safety by the way.
23:45:13,23:50:19,"Think about it, confidence actually comes from safety."
23:51:08,23:56:20,"If you feel safe, you can start to gather the feeling of confidence."
23:57:00,24:05:13,"If you go into a situation where the client, you never seen the client, big shot okay, he is going to give you a hundred million dollar deal. He is going to give you a million dollar deal."
24:05:23,24:09:10,"He is going to buy a million dollar from you. Okay, in terms of products."
24:09:21,24:13:13,"Okay. And you go in, you feel nervous right?"
24:14:04,24:20:16,"The guy comes in and he tells you don't worry, you know, if you can convince me, this deal is yours."
24:22:13,24:25:11,Do you feel that you are somewhere part way there already?
24:25:18,24:27:24,"Not bad, you feel safe right? You can start."
24:28:16,24:32:22,"True? You go in too for some of you, you meet up with a group of people."
24:33:13,24:42:09,"This group of people they are noisy, they don't want to listen to you. You go in and you say hi everybody hello can I can I, can you give me some time I want to talk to you."
24:43:06,24:45:13,Do you feel safe? No.
24:45:24,24:51:05,"But when you go in and you say, you know, ladies and gentlemen give me some time, give me abit of your time."
24:51:21,24:56:09,"And they actually turn around and look at you, do you feel safe?"
24:57:06,25:05:12,Confidence comes. Confidence comes from other things before confidence comes. A lot state comes from something else before it comes.
25:06:08,25:10:12,"And when you build up to that state, you just to remember prior to that what is it."
25:11:08,25:12:19,"If you have one state,"
25:13:17,25:17:14,"confident, you have another state, in control."
25:18:04,25:22:15,"Can you take the state, the template for that, put them together?"
25:25:20,25:31:22,Can. Can you be happy and be contented at the same time?
25:32:08,25:38:11,"Can. Can you remember a time when you are happy and after that you felt life, this is life."
25:38:21,25:41:21,Ever? They can be stack together.
25:42:22,25:45:20,Can you be happy and sad at the same time?
25:48:13,25:50:11,Some states are conflicting.
25:50:24,25:53:21,Can you be nervous and confident at the same time?
25:55:03,26:01:10,Harder. Okay. If you ever had that means that somewhere somehow is really super mis-aligned okay.
26:01:22,06:07:10,Okay I had shared with your about what neuro-lingusitic programming is about and how it helps in terms of sales.
06:07:11,26:15:00,"So the whole fundamental concept of sales and positioning right, if I were to round it up, okay, from the start is this."
26:15:07,26:20:23,"Imagine the very fact that is before sales even happen, "
26:21:12,26:27:03,"the ability to take what you thoughts are,"
26:27:04,26:28:14,"what you say to yourself,"
26:28:15,26:33:01,"and how you behave, you align it, okay,"
26:33:02,26:37:00,"and you not only that, you get a sense that you can focus on the conversation,"
26:37:01,26:41:22,"you can focus out of the conversation to get data, big data, okay."
26:41:23,26:45:06,"Take the information on the big data, know when to pick it up,"
26:45:07,26:48:24,"focus back in, okay, engage the client in such a way."
26:49:00,26:54:02," And with the alignment right, we also talked about state management,"
26:54:03,26:56:07,"how then do you have the optimal state,"
26:56:08,26:58:21,"how do you go in, how do you talk to the client, "
26:58:22,27:02:05,"how do you be in a state where you are comfortable, you are genuine, "
27:02:06,27:07:13,"you are confident. You lap them up together, you template them you lap them up together,"
27:07:14,27:11:12,"go into that state, have a conversation with them,"
27:11:13,27:13:10,"know that you can make them comfortable,"
27:13:11,27:16:04,"know that with the state you are in you are powerful enough,"
27:16:05,27:18:07,"to manage it with them together,"
27:18:07,27:20:21,"and at the same time when they are sharing information,"
27:20:22,27:23:21,"you are out gathering information, you are focusing in,"
27:23:22,27:26:17,"the conversation goes very dynamic, okay."
27:26:18,27:28:02,"And with the state that you are,"
27:28:03,27:31:15,"you know that when they are comfortable you know when to push the button,"
27:31:16,27:36:12,"okay so that they, you know, as much as they are comfortable you want them to buy right."
27:36:13,27:39:23,"You know when to push the button, they will say okay I will consider,"
27:39:24,27:43:15,"good, consider more, push a little bit more button,"
27:43:16,27:46:10,"push it more. Or when you realised that they are uncomfortable,"
24:46:11,27:50:12,"you know it because you are out, you know you can get out of the state, stop focusing on it."
27:50:22,27:56:20,"Goes into peripheral, get out. You have the sensory acuity you can get out of it, and then,"
27:56:21,28:01:02,"get them into a comfortable state again, put yourself back into an optimal state."
28:01:03,28:03:16,"Get them natural, get them comfortable, push again."
28:03:17,28:08:11,"This whole process, in and out itself, is the optimal sales process."
